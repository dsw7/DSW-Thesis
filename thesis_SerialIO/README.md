### WarrenLabLaserTable hardware serial communication  

<p align="justify">
In this folder, I place examples of all scripts for connecting and disconnecting
to hardware used for the Warren lab laser table. I have made every effort to ensure
all scripts are written according to the documentation for their respective hardware.
I have also made sure that all scripts work standalone such that future lab members
can replicate their execution.
