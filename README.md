## Description of directories:

    ~/DSW-Thesis/thesis_Bridging_workdir/                // contains high level Met-aromatic implementation for getting bridges
    ~/DSW-Thesis/thesis_Chain_comparator/                // contains all code for assessing bridge / aromatic chain superimposition
    ~/DSW-Thesis/thesis_Met-aromatic_workdir_HIGHLEVEL   // contains a high level Pandas/BioPython Met-aromatic algorithm implementation
    ~/DSW-Thesis/thesis_Met-aromatic_cplusplus           // contains a very basic C++ implementation of Met-aromatic algorithm
    ~/DSW-Thesis/thesis_PDB_to_DFT                       // contains workflow for translating DMS approx. relative to aromatic plane + DFT
    ~/DSW-Thesis/thesis_SerialIO                         // contains example MATLAB code for Warren Lab laser hardware serial communication
    ~/DSW-Thesis/thesis_PDB_to_DFT_part2                 // second workflow for computing Morse surfaces as a function of ||v||, Met-theta angle
    ~/DSW-Thesis/xyz_file_generator.py                   // contains a homemade .xyz file generator
    ~/DSW-Thesis/PyOpenGL_MetAromatic_Animation          // contains a PyOpenGL/pygame animation of the Met-aromatic algorithm

The following was transported out to the new repository: https://github.com/dsw7/MetAromaticEngine

    ~/DSW-Thesis/thesis_Met-aromatic_workdir_LOWLEVEL    // contains a lower level implementation of Met-aromatic algorithm
