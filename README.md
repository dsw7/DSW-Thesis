## Description of directories:

    ~/DSW-Thesis/thesis_bridging_workdir/                // contains high level Met-aromatic implementation for getting bridges
    ~/DSW-Thesis/thesis_chain_comparator/                // contains all code for assessing bridge / aromatic chain superimposition
    ~/DSW-Thesis/thesis_met_aromatic_workdir_highlevel   // contains a high level Pandas/BioPython Met-aromatic algorithm implementation
    ~/DSW-Thesis/thesis_met_aromatic_cxx                 // contains a very basic C++ implementation of Met-aromatic algorithm
    ~/DSW-Thesis/thesis_pdb_to_dft                       // contains workflow for translating DMS approx. relative to aromatic plane + DFT
    ~/DSW-Thesis/thesis_serial_io_examples               // contains example MATLAB code for Warren Lab laser hardware serial communication
    ~/DSW-Thesis/thesis_pdb_to_dft_II                    // second workflow for computing Morse surfaces as a function of ||v||, Met-theta angle
    ~/DSW-Thesis/xyz_file_generator.py                   // contains a homemade .xyz file generator
    ~/DSW-Thesis/pyopengl_met_aromatic_animation         // contains a PyOpenGL/pygame animation of the Met-aromatic algorithm

The following was transported out to the new repository: https://github.com/dsw7/MetAromatic

    ~/DSW-Thesis/thesis_Met-aromatic_workdir_LOWLEVEL    // contains a lower level implementation of Met-aromatic algorithm
